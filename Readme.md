Example of Imperative Shell / Functional core

Original source code take is from Bartłomiej Słota https://github.com/bslota/refactoring-to-solid-code and
 translated to kotlin
 
 
The code is refactored in branch  kotlin_functional_core to apply Imperative Shell / Functional
 core pattern
 
Some notes:   
 The imperative shell logic is almost not existing , the test could also avoided  
 The functional core become very very simple to test because there is no need to mock or stubs
